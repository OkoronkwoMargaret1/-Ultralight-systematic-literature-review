This paper addresses the issue of the "quality of translations" by English Wikipedia translators who are translating to other language versions. The author used the Mossop's taxonomy of editing and revision of procedures in Wikipedia article translation to discover that the articles are being poorly translated. This is arguably due to lack of formal trainings and professional work experiences as translators.

This paper discusses the shortcomings that has shown its capacity in contributing to the imbalances being faced in Wikipedia translation. It reports the results of analysis carried out on the Finnish, French and Japanese Wikipedias and the focus is on community interactions. The authors argue that though the discussion pages contributes to Wikipedia, however, there are lapses on the in-depth studies conducted on the type of communication and collaboration in the multilingual Wikipedia. These differences are rising on the account of source referencing, proper nouns and transliterations in the articles rather than mechanical translation of words and sentences.

This article discusses the concept of translation in Wikipedia with respect to all the languages that were available at the time- January 2015 as well as a bit of an insight on how the translation process was carried out. An analysis was executed on translation entries, and it was discovered that the entries were screened to determine the contents, ideas, creatives and innovations that were pertinent to  the global scope of translations contribution and those that were language-bound. There is a discussion pages that analysed these entries and isolated contents that highlighted specific problem relating to vandalism, publicity and thinkgroups because of the assumption that those are not matters that are essential to global view.
